  "articleBody": "The template produces a personal website with Hugo , which is a very fast, open-source static website generator. The website design is based on PaperMod , which is a minimalist, fast, and flexible Hugo theme. Finally, the website is hosted on GitHub Pages ; but it could easily be hosted on other services.\nThe design has been customized for academic websites. The first goal was to obtain a minimalist website that is easy to navigate. The second goal was to obtain a website that highlights the research and teaching material. The third goal was to have a website that performs well (fast to load, good SEO, good accessibility). The website performs very well on mobile and desktop devices—just like the original PaperMod theme. The final goal was to design a website that is easy to maintain and expand.\nView Hugo template for academic websites Website produced by the template Key features Webpages are organized in several categories, which are available from any page through the menu and from the homepage through buttons: papers, courses, data, and so on. The template accepts LaTeX expressions to typeset math on all webpages. The template provides social icons specific to academia: CV, email address, office location, office hours, Zoom room, GitHub profile, Substack profile, Google Scholar profile, and so on. An archive page is automatically generated so visitors can easily see the most recent material added to the website. A list of keywords used in papers and courses is automatically generated so visitors can easily see the topics covered in research and teaching. The metadata for webpages, which appear below the webpage title, are tailored to the academic context. Color scheme, font, spacing, and general appearance are streamlined and as minimalist as possible. Tables, code blocks, quote blocks, itemized and numbered lists are formatted to fit seamlessly with the rest of the website. Installation On your local machine Clone the repository to your local machine Install Hugo . On a Mac, this is easily done with Homebrew . Simply run the following command in the terminal: brew install hugo. Since the website is hosted on GitHub Pages, it is convenient to install GitHub Desktop . The website can conveniently be updated from your local machine via GitHub Desktop without going to GitHub. Update the baseURL parameter in config.yml with the website URL that you plan to use. On your GitHub account The first time that you push your repository to GitHub, you need to allow GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages so the website can be built and deployed to GitHub Pages. The first step is to ask GitHub to publish the website with a GitHub Action. GitHub offers a ready-made action to publish a Hugo website, called Deploy Hugo site to Pages. This action must be enabled in the Pages Settings of your GitHub repository. You can view the workflow triggered by the action in the .github/workflows/hugo.yml file. Once the GitHub Actions are enabled, GitHub will build and publish the website as soon as the repository is updated. If you would like to update the GitHub action (for instance because it became outdated and fails to deploy the site), you can find the most recent action on GitHub . You can place this file directly in the .github/workflows folder to replace the old hugo.yml file. Usage Development To check that everything works, experiment with the code, and slowly develop your website, start by rebuilding the website locally. In the terminal, navigate to your website directory and run hugo server from there. The command builds the website with Hugo and starts a local web server. The website is then available at http://localhost:1313 in any web browser. Hugo automatically rebuilds the site and refreshes the web page in the browser as changes are made to the files (content, templates) in the repository. This allows you to see changes instantly as you are developing your website.\nCompilation Once your website is ready to be made public, run hugo in the terminal from your website directory. This command will convert content files into HTML pages, handles static assets, generates URLs and organizes pages, and finally compile the website into the public folder for deployment. The current version of the website is built with Hugo v0.128.2.\nDeployment With GitHub Desktop, you can just commit the changes and push them to the GitHub repository online. Then, GitHub Actions will build the website and deploy it to GitHub Pages. The workflow used by GitHub Actions is in the hugo.yml file stored in the .github/workflows folder. It usually takes a few minutes for the website to be deployed and go live.\nConfiguration file The config.yml file contains all the parameters to configure the website. Upon cloning the source code to your local machine, make sure to update them and add any additional parameter that you would like to customize. Such parameters include:\nbaseURL – The website URL title – Your name, to be used as title of the website params:author - Your name, to be used in HTML meta tags to specify the author of the webpage’s content (this only adds a meta tag to the header of the homepage, it doesn’t have any direct impact on the appearance or functionality of the webpage itself) params:description – A short description (less than 155 characters) of who you are, to be used in HTML meta tags to specify the content of the webpage (this description often appears in search engine results below the title of the webpage) params:googleAnalyticsID – The website’s Google Analytics ID (the website supports Google Analytics 4) params:profileMode:title – Your name, to be used as title on the homepage params:profileMode:subtitle – A description of who you are, to be used as a subtitle on the homepage params:profileMode:imageTitle – Your name, to be used as tag for your profile picture params:socialIcons – The URLs to your social accounts and contact information cover:hiddenInList – Set to true to hide cover images in paper, course, and data lists paginate – The maximum number of entries to show on each list page Content files The content folder contains all the content files for the website. These files are written in Markdown , a simple markup language designed to make writing on the web fast and easy. Each file corresponds to one page of the website.\nMost of the files organized in four categories, which are available from any page through the navigation menu and from the homepage through buttons:\nPapers – Published and unpublished research papers, stored in the papers subfolder Courses – Undergraduate and graduate courses, stored in the courses subfolder Data – Data projects, stored in the data subfolder Books – Books, stored in the books subfolder The category pages include a list of the items in the category (books, papers, courses, data), with links to individual items. These lists are updated automatically as content files are added, deleted, or modified in the specific subfolders.\nNew items To add a new paper to the website, for instance, add a file new_paper.md into the papers subfolder. That new paper will automatically be listed on the page with the other papers . It is convenient to use archetypes to generate new files easily.\nBy default, the URL of the new paper would be baseURL/papers/new_paper/. But the URL can be customized in the new_paper.md file with the url parameter. For instance, with url: /paperx/, the URL of the new paper is simplified to baseURL/paperx/.\nNew categories It is also easy to add new categories to the website, for instance to list software, blog entries, and so on. To add a list of software, create a new software subfolder into the content folder. Then add a content file such as new_software.md into the software subfolder. That new category will be available at baseURL/software/.\nYou can for instance link to it with a button from the homepage. To do that, simply add the following snippet into the config.yml file, below profileMode:buttons:\n- name: Software url: software/ You can also add a link to the new category in the menu bar. To do that, simply add the following snippet into the config.yml file, below menu:main:\n- name: Software url: software/ weight: 4 Other content files The content folder contains a few additional files, which are not part of categories.\nlocation.md – Mailing and office addresses, including a map of the university officehours.md – Schedule and location for office hours It is possible to add any number of files in the content folder. By default, any new_file.md file will be available at baseURL/new_file/.\nStatic files The static folder contains the static files (files not processed or rendered by Hugo) for the website. The static folder contains a few files used in the homepage:\npicture.jpeg – Picture appearing on the homepage. cv.pdf – Curriculum vitae linked to the CV icon on the homepage. This CV is based on the CV template created by Matthew Butterick . favicon.io, favicon-32x32.png, favicon-16x16.png, apple-touch-icon.png – Favicon appearing in the menu bar next to the website title, and in the browser next to the URL. It is easy to produce new favicons . The static folder could also include the PDF files and images to which the website links. It could contain:\nPapers and online appendices in PDF format Presentations in PDF format Lecture notes in PDF format Figures from the papers in PNG format This is for instance how I organized the static files on my website . But in the template, to be more flexible and portable, these files are located directly in the folder for the individual page where they are used: content/papers/paper1/, content/papers/paper2/, content/courses/course1/, and so on.\nKeywords A list of all the keywords (tags) used in papers and courses is automatically generated and added to the website. The tag list is accessible from the homepage. The list can also be added to the menu bar. To do that, simply add the following snippet into the config.yml file, below menu:main:\n- name: Keywords url: tags/ weight: 5 Specific tags can be added to any webpage with the tags parameter. Such tags appear at the bottom of the page in small gray buttons.\nThe tag list is generated by default, but it can be customized through the file _index.md placed in the content/tags/ folder. The file defines for instance the description of the page for search engines (description) as well as the title of the page (title).\nArchive The website also features an archive . The archive displays a chronological list of all papers, books, courses, and data projects. The list of categories displayed in the archive is controlled by the parameter params:MainSections in the config.yml file. The current value of that parameter is\nparams:MainSections: [\"books\",\"courses\",\"papers\",\"data\"] The archive is accessible from the homepage. Add the following snippet below menu:main: in the config.yml file to make the archive available from the menu:\n- name: Archive url: archive/ weight: 7 The archive is available at baseURL/archive/.\nSocial icons The template includes various social icons that are commonly used in academia. All the icons are defined in the file layouts/partials/svg.html; additional icons can be added there. To place any icon on the homepage, the icon type and icon url should be specified below params:socialIcons: in config.yml.\nFor instance, if your CV is called cv.pdf and placed in the static folder, an icon linking to your CV can be added as follows:\n- name: CV url: cv.pdf If your office hours are listed on the page officehours.md in the content folder, an icon linking to your office hours can be added as follows:\n- name: Office Hours url: officehours/ If your office address is listed on the page location.md in the content folder, an icon linking to your address can be added as follows:\n- name: Location url: location/ If your Zoom room is located at https://www.zoom.us/my/user, it is possible to link to it by adding the following snippet:\n- name: Zoom url: https://www.zoom.us/my/user If your Google Scholar profile is located at https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=user, link to it by adding the following snippet:\n- name: Google Scholar url: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=user Similarly, if your GitHub profile is located at https://github.com/user, link to it by adding the following snippet:\n- name: GitHub url: https://github.com/user Finally, if your email is user@gmail.com, you can link to it by adding the following snippet:\n- name: Email url: mailto:user@gmail.com Typesetting math It is easy to typeset math on any website page. Simply enter LaTeX commands into the Markdown file, and the commands will be rendered synchronously with KaTeX .\nFor instance $x\\in \\mathbb{N}$ is rendered as $x\\in \\mathbb{N}$. $\\xi^\\ast = \\max f(x)$ is rendered as $\\xi^\\ast = \\max f(x)$. And $4 \\ln(\\theta+\\mathcal{Y}) =4 \\int \\ln(x^2)dx$ is rendered as $4 \\ln(\\theta+\\mathcal{Y}) =4 \\int \\ln(x^2)dx$.\nIt is also possible to display equations on any webpage. For example, $$1+\\lambda\\exp{\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha^2}} = \\max_{t\\in\\mathbb{R}}(x(t)-y(t)+z(t)^2)$$ is rendered as:\n$$1+\\lambda\\exp{\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha^2}} = \\max_{t\\in\\mathbb{R}}(x(t)-y(t)+z(t)^2).$$\nColor scheme Most of the website produced by the template is in grayscale. For ease of navigation, however, links underlined in orange. The same orange color is used for the website’s favicon, and a lighter shade of orange is used for hovered buttons.\nIt is easy to personalize the color used for links and buttons. The orange color is specified in the file assets/css/core/theme-vars.css. The code snippet specifying the color is:\n--darkcolor: #d95f0e; --lightcolor: #fed582; The two shades of orange are specifed by their hex code. Enter other hex codes to modify the website’s color scheme. Using the same hex codes, it is easy to produce a new favicon with a different color to match the website’s color scheme.\nFooter The website has a footer. The footer contains a copyright notice and a “Powered by” notice. The footer can be customized by modifying the file layouts/partials/footer.html. It is possible to hide the footer by setting the parameter hideFooter to true in the config.yml file.\nCover images Cover images can be specified for all pages. The cover image will appear in lists on the website. It will also appear if a link to the page is used on social media.\nLet’s look at the page for the first paper on the website, “Unusual Uses For Olive Oil”. A cover image for the page is specified at the top of the index.md file in the content/papers/paper1/ folder:\ncover: image: \"paper1.png\" alt: \"Some Uses For Olive Oil\" relative: false The cover image is paper1.png, found in the same folder as the index.md file. The image is in PNG format, which is the recommended format for cover images.\nCover images should be 1280x720 pixels. This size ensures that the cover image has a 16:9 aspect ratio (recommended for most social media), have a good resolution, while not being too large (100–300 KB is recommended). The image should also have some white padding around, to prevent important material from being cropped out.\nTo produce good cover images, Image Magick is a great software. It is free and open source and can be obtained on a Mac with Homebrew: brew install imagemagick. Once you have installed Image Magick, you can transform any image in PNG format to a cover image of the appropriate size with some padding:\nmagick image.png -resize 1200x675 -gravity center -background white -extent 1280x720 image.png RSS feeds In the background, Hugo automatically generates RSS feeds in XML format for your site. These feeds enable interested readers to subscribe to your content and be updated whenever you publish new content. The RSS feeds can be found in the public folder, and are typically available at /index.xml under the appropriate section.\nFor instance, on this website, the RSS feed for my research papers can be found at https://pascalmichaillat.org/papers/index.xml. The RSS feed for my design projects can be found at https://pascalmichaillat.org/design/index.xml. Hugo also produces RSS feeds for all keywords. On this website, the RSS feed for the keyword business cycles can be found at https://pascalmichaillat.org/tags/business-cycles/index.xml and the RSS feed for the keyword recessions can be found at https://pascalmichaillat.org/tags/recessions/index.xml.\nThe XML files can then be submitted to RSS readers, such as the RSS app , to produce RSS feeds .\nSearch A search page can also be added to the website. To add a search page, move the search.md file from the archetypes folder into the content folder. Then, add the following snippet at the end of the config.yml file so that search works properly:\noutputs: home: - HTML - RSS - JSON Finally, add the following snippet below menu:main: in the config.yml file to make the search page available from the menu:\n- name: Search url: search/ weight: 6 The search page will be available at baseURL/search/.\nArchetypes The template comes with archetypes, stored in the archetypes folder. In Hugo, an archetype is a predefined content template that serves as a blueprint for creating new pages. Archetypes help streamline content creation by providing a consistent starting point with predefined metadata and content structure. There is an archetype for paper pages (paper.md) and an archetype for course pages (course.md).\nTo create a new webpage from an archetype, simply use the hugo new command in the terminal from the website directory. For example, to create a page for a new course, you can run:\nhugo new content/courses/my-new-teaching-material.md --kind course Hugo will generate a new content file called my-new-teaching-material.md and place it the directory content/courses/, where all the courses are stored. Furthermore, Hugo will use the archetype course.md. Then, you can edit the content of the page by modifying the newly created file my-new-teaching-material.md.\nSimilarly, to create a page for a new paper, you can run:\nhugo new content/papers/my-new-research-material.md --kind paper Hugo will generate a new content file called my-new-research-material.md and place it the directory content/papers/, where all the papers are stored. Furthermore, Hugo will use the archetype paper.md.\nRedirects It is easy to handle redirects on a Hugo website by using the aliases parameter within the page front matter. This feature allows you to define old URLs that should redirect to a new page. This is particularly useful when you change the URL structure or move content around in your website, and you want to ensure that visitors are redirected from the old URLs to the new one. This ensures that visitors using the old URLs still find the right content.\nThe template includes an example showing how to set up redirects using the aliases parameter. The redirects are set up in the /courses/course1/index.md file. In the preamble, the following snippet of code sets up redirects from old PDF files to the current course page:\naliases: - /courses/course2/slides4.pdf - /courses/course2/slides1.pdf - /courses/course2/slides3.pdf - /courses/course2/slides2.pdf - /courses/course2/notes3.pdf - /courses/course2/notes4.pdf - /courses/course2/ps3.pdf - /courses/course2/ps4.pdf - /courses/course1/quiz1.pdf - /courses/course1/quiz2.pdf - /courses/course2/quiz3.pdf - /courses/course2/quiz4.pdf - /courses/course1/ps1.pdf Hugo will then automatically generate the necessary redirect HTML pages during the build process. These HTML pages will be stored in the public folder. When a visitor navigates to any of the URLs listed in the aliases (such as baseURL/courses/course2/slides4.pdf), they will be redirected to the page where the alias is defined (baseURL/courses/course1/).\nThis method is useful to manage redirects and ensure a seamless user experience when restructuring any part of your website. It is also useful to handle 404 issues since outdated links will automatically point to the correct content, preventing users from landing on the 404 error page .\nPublic folder The public folder contains the fully generated static website files that are ready to be deployed to GitHub Pages. When you run the hugo command, Hugo processes your content, templates, and other project files and generates a static website. The resulting output is placed in the public folder by default.\nThe public folder can always be safely deleted. A new version of the public folder will be created when you run the hugo command in the terminal.\nDomain name It is easy to use a custom domain name for the website. For instance, the domain name https://pascalmichaillat.org/ is registered with Squarespace . Once you have registered a domain, you need to link it to your website. Make sure that the baseURL parameter in config.yml reflects the custom domain name. Make sure that the page setting on GitHub also includes the domain name.\nTips for job-market candidates This template is designed for researchers at all levels, including students, postdocs, faculty members, and professional scientists. When preparing your website for the job market, it might make sense to adapt the website slightly.\nJob-market status To announce your job-market status, you can modify the subtitle on the landing page. You could for instance add\n**In 2024/2025, I will be on the academic job market.** to the text under params:profileMode:subtitle in the config.yml file.\nYou could also add more information, such as who your references are, how to contact them, which job-market meetings you will attend, and so on.\nButtons for job-market paper and CV I would also advise to place prominent links to your CV and job-market paper on the landing page. This can be easily achieved by adding the following code snippet below profileMode:buttons: in the config.yml file:\n- name: Job-market paper url: jmp.pdf - name: Curriculum vitae url: cv.pdf This code snippet will add buttons for your job-market paper (jmp.pdf) and CV (cv.pdf) below the social icons on the homepage. The files cv.pdf and jmp.pdf must be placed in the static folder.\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>The template produces a personal website with <a href="https://gohugo.io" target="_blank">Hugo</a>
, which is a very fast, open-source static website generator. The website design is based on <a href="https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod" target="_blank">PaperMod</a>
, which is a minimalist, fast, and flexible Hugo theme. Finally, the website is hosted on <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>
; but it could easily be hosted on other services.</p>
<p>The design has been customized for academic websites. The first goal was to obtain a minimalist website that is easy to navigate. The second goal was to obtain a website that highlights the research and teaching material. The third goal was to have a website that performs well (fast to load, good SEO, good accessibility). The website <a href="https://github.com/pmichaillat/hugo-website#performance" target="_blank">performs very well</a>
 on mobile and desktop devices—just like the original PaperMod theme. The final goal was to design a website that is easy to maintain and expand.</p>

<ul>
<li>Webpages are organized in several categories, which are available from any page through the menu and from the homepage through buttons: papers, courses, data, and so on.</li>
<li>The template accepts LaTeX expressions to typeset math on all webpages.</li>
<li>The template provides social icons specific to academia: CV, email address, office location, office hours, Zoom room, GitHub profile, Substack profile, Google Scholar profile, and so on.</li>
<li>An archive page is automatically generated so visitors can easily see the most recent material added to the website.</li>
<li>A list of keywords used in papers and courses is automatically generated so visitors can easily see the topics covered in research and teaching.</li>
<li>The metadata for webpages, which appear below the webpage title, are tailored to the academic context.</li>
<li>Color scheme, font, spacing, and general appearance are streamlined and as minimalist as possible.</li>
<li>Tables, code blocks, quote blocks, itemized and numbered lists are formatted to fit seamlessly with the rest of the website.</li>

<h3 id="on-your-local-machine">On your local machine<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#on-your-local-machine">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Clone the repository to your local machine</li>
<li>Install <a href="https://gohugo.io/installation/" target="_blank">Hugo</a>
. On a Mac, this is easily done with <a href="https://brew.sh" target="_blank">Homebrew</a>
. Simply run the following command in the terminal: <code>brew install hugo</code>.</li>
<li>Since the website is hosted on GitHub Pages, it is convenient to install <a href="https://desktop.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub Desktop</a>
. The website can conveniently be updated from your local machine via GitHub Desktop without going to GitHub.</li>
<li>Update the <code>baseURL</code> parameter in <code>config.yml</code> with the website URL that you plan to use.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="on-your-github-account">On your GitHub account<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#on-your-github-account">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The first time that you push your repository to GitHub, you need to allow GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages so the website can be built and deployed to GitHub Pages.</li>
<li>The first step is to ask GitHub to <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#publishing-with-a-custom-github-actions-workflow" target="_blank">publish the website</a>
 with a GitHub Action.  GitHub offers a ready-made action to publish a Hugo website, called <code>Deploy Hugo site to Pages</code>. This action must be enabled in the <a href="https://github.com/pmichaillat/hugo-website/settings/pages" target="_blank">Pages Settings</a>
 of your GitHub repository. You can view the workflow triggered by the action in the <code>.github/workflows/hugo.yml</code> file.</li>
<li>Once the GitHub Actions are enabled, GitHub will build and publish the website as soon as the repository is updated.</li>
<li>If you would like to update the GitHub action (for instance because it became outdated and fails to deploy the site), you can find the <a href="https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/blob/main/pages/hugo.yml" target="_blank">most recent action on GitHub</a>
. You can place this file directly in the <code>.github/workflows</code> folder to replace the old <code>hugo.yml</code> file.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="usage">Usage<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#usage">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="development">Development<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#development">#</a></h3>
<p>To check that everything works, experiment with the code, and slowly develop your website, start by rebuilding the website locally. In the terminal, navigate to your website directory and run <code>hugo server</code> from there. The command builds the website with Hugo and starts a local web server. The website is then available at http://localhost:1313 in any web browser. Hugo automatically rebuilds the site and refreshes the web page in the browser as changes are made to the files (content, templates) in the repository. This allows you to see changes instantly as you are developing your website.</p>
<h3 id="compilation">Compilation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#compilation">#</a></h3>
<p>Once your website is ready to be made public, run <code>hugo</code> in the terminal from your website directory. This command will convert content files into HTML pages, handles static assets, generates URLs and organizes pages, and finally compile the website into the <code>public</code> folder for deployment. The <a href="https://pascalmichaillat.org/hugo-website/" target="_blank">current version of the website</a>
 is built with Hugo v0.128.2.</p>
<h3 id="deployment">Deployment<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#deployment">#</a></h3>
<p>With GitHub Desktop, you can just commit the changes and push them to the GitHub repository online. Then, GitHub Actions will build the website and deploy it to GitHub Pages. The workflow used by GitHub Actions is in the <code>hugo.yml</code> file stored in the <code>.github/workflows</code> folder. It usually takes a few minutes for the website to be deployed and go live.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="configuration-file">Configuration file<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#configuration-file">#</a></h2>
<p>The <code>config.yml</code> file contains all the parameters to configure the website. Upon cloning the source code to your local machine, make sure to update them and add any additional parameter that you would like to customize. Such parameters include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>baseURL</code> – The website URL</li>
<li><code>title</code> – Your name, to be used as title of the website</li>
<li><code>params:author</code> - Your name, to be used in HTML meta tags to specify the author of the webpage&rsquo;s content (this only adds a meta tag to the header of the homepage, it doesn&rsquo;t have any direct impact on the appearance or functionality of the webpage itself)</li>
<li><code>params:description</code> – A short description (less than 155 characters) of who you are, to be used in HTML meta tags to specify the content of the webpage (this description often appears in search engine results below the title of the webpage)</li>
<li><code>params:googleAnalyticsID</code> – The website&rsquo;s Google Analytics ID (the website supports Google Analytics 4)</li>
<li><code>params:profileMode:title</code> – Your name, to be used as title on the homepage</li>
<li><code>params:profileMode:subtitle</code> – A description of who you are, to be used as a subtitle on the homepage</li>
<li><code>params:profileMode:imageTitle</code> – Your name, to be used as tag for your profile picture</li>
<li><code>params:socialIcons</code> – The URLs to your <a href="#social-icons">social accounts and contact information</a>
</li>
<li><code>cover:hiddenInList</code> – Set to <code>true</code> to hide cover images in paper, course, and data lists</li>
<li><code>paginate</code> – The maximum number of entries to show on each list page</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="content-files">Content files<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#content-files">#</a></h2>
<p>The <code>content</code> folder contains all the content files for the website. These files are written in <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org" target="_blank">Markdown</a>
, a simple markup language designed to make writing on the web fast and easy. Each file corresponds to one page of the website.</p>
<p>Most of the files organized in four categories, which are available from any page through the navigation menu and from the homepage through buttons:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pascalmichaillat.org/hugo-website/papers/" target="_blank">Papers</a>
 – Published and unpublished research papers, stored in the <code>papers</code> subfolder</li>
<li><a href="https://pascalmichaillat.org/hugo-website/courses/" target="_blank">Courses</a>
 – Undergraduate and graduate courses, stored in the <code>courses</code> subfolder</li>
<li><a href="https://pascalmichaillat.org/hugo-website/data/" target="_blank">Data</a>
 – Data projects, stored in the <code>data</code> subfolder</li>
<li><a href="https://pascalmichaillat.org/hugo-website/books/" target="_blank">Books</a>
 – Books, stored in the <code>books</code> subfolder</li>
</ul>
<p>The category pages include a list of the items in the category (books, papers, courses, data), with links to individual items. These lists are updated automatically as content files are added, deleted, or modified in the specific subfolders.</p>
<h3 id="new-items">New items<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#new-items">#</a></h3>
<p>To add a new paper to the website, for instance, add a file <code>new_paper.md</code> into the <code>papers</code> subfolder. That new paper will automatically be listed on the <a href="https://pascalmichaillat.org/hugo-website/papers/" target="_blank">page with the other papers</a>
. It is convenient to <a href="#archetypes">use archetypes</a>
 to generate new files easily.</p>
<p>By default, the URL of the new paper would be <code>baseURL/papers/new_paper/</code>. But the URL can be customized in the <code>new_paper.md</code> file with the <code>url</code> parameter. For instance, with <code>url: /paperx/</code>, the URL of the new paper is simplified to <code>baseURL/paperx/</code>.</p>
<h3 id="new-categories">New categories<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#new-categories">#</a></h3>
<p>It is also easy to add new categories to the website, for instance to list software, blog entries, and so on. To add a list of software, create a new <code>software</code> subfolder into the <code>content</code> folder. Then add a content file such as <code>new_software.md</code> into the <code>software</code> subfolder. That new category will be available at <code>baseURL/software/</code>.</p>
<p>You can for instance link to it with a button from the homepage. To do that, simply add the following snippet into the <code>config.yml</code> file, below <code>profileMode:buttons</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-yml" data-lang="yml"><span style="display:flex;"><span>- <span style="color:#000">name</span>: <span style="color:#1c01ce">Software</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#000">url</span>: <span style="color:#1c01ce">software/</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You can also add a link to the new category in the menu bar. To do that, simply add the following snippet into the <code>config.yml</code> file, below <code>menu:main</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-yml" data-lang="yml"><span style="display:flex;"><span>- <span style="color:#000">name</span>: <span style="color:#1c01ce">Software</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#000">url</span>: <span style="color:#1c01ce">software/</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#000">weight</span>: <span style="color:#1c01ce">4</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="other-content-files">Other content files<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#other-content-files">#</a></h3>
<p>The <code>content</code> folder contains a few additional files, which are not part of categories.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>location.md</code> – Mailing and office addresses, including a map of the university</li>
<li><code>officehours.md</code> – Schedule and location for office hours</li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible to add any number of files in the <code>content</code> folder. By default, any <code>new_file.md</code> file will be available at <code>baseURL/new_file/</code>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="static-files">Static files<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#static-files">#</a></h2>
<p>The <code>static</code> folder contains the static files (files not processed or rendered by Hugo) for the website. The <code>static</code> folder contains a few files used in the homepage:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>picture.jpeg</code> – Picture appearing on the homepage.</li>
<li><code>cv.pdf</code> – Curriculum vitae linked to the <a href="#social-icons">CV icon</a>
 on the homepage. This CV is based on the CV template created by <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/resumes.html" target="_blank">Matthew Butterick</a>
.</li>
<li><code>favicon.io</code>, <code>favicon-32x32.png</code>, <code>favicon-16x16.png</code>, <code>apple-touch-icon.png</code> – Favicon appearing in the menu bar next to the website title, and in the browser next to the URL. It is easy to produce <a href="https://favicon.io" target="_blank">new favicons</a>
.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>static</code> folder could also include the PDF files and images to which the website links. It could contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>Papers and online appendices in PDF format</li>
<li>Presentations in PDF format</li>
<li>Lecture notes in PDF format</li>
<li>Figures from the papers in PNG format</li>
</ul>
<p>This is for instance how I organized the static files <a href="https://github.com/pmichaillat/pmichaillat.github.io" target="_blank">on my website</a>
. But in the template, to be more flexible and portable, these files are located directly in the folder for the individual page where they are used: <code>content/papers/paper1/</code>, <code>content/papers/paper2/</code>, <code>content/courses/course1/</code>, and so on.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="keywords">Keywords<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#keywords">#</a></h2>
<p>A list of all the <a href="https://pascalmichaillat.org/hugo-website/tags/" target="_blank">keywords (tags)</a>
 used in papers and courses is automatically generated and added to the website. The tag list is accessible from the homepage. The list can also be added to the menu bar. To do that, simply add the following snippet into the <code>config.yml</code> file, below <code>menu:main</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-yml" data-lang="yml"><span style="display:flex;"><span>- <span style="color:#000">name</span>: <span style="color:#1c01ce">Keywords</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#000">url</span>: <span style="color:#1c01ce">tags/</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#000">weight</span>: <span style="color:#1c01ce">5</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Specific tags can be added to any webpage with the <code>tags</code> parameter. Such tags appear at the bottom of the page in small gray buttons.</p>
<p>The tag list is generated by default, but it can be customized through the file <code>_index.md</code> placed in the  <code>content/tags/</code> folder. The file defines for instance the description of the page for search engines (<code>description</code>) as well as the title of the page (<code>title</code>).</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="archive">Archive<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#archive">#</a></h2>
<p>The website also features <a href="https://pascalmichaillat.org/hugo-website/archive/" target="_blank">an archive</a>
. The archive displays a chronological list of all papers, books, courses, and data projects. The list of categories displayed in the archive is controlled by the parameter <code>params:MainSections</code> in the <code>config.yml</code> file. The current value of that parameter is</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-yml" data-lang="yml"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#000">params:MainSections</span>: [<span style="color:#c41a16">&#34;books&#34;</span>,<span style="color:#c41a16">&#34;courses&#34;</span>,<span style="color:#c41a16">&#34;papers&#34;</span>,<span style="color:#c41a16">&#34;data&#34;</span>]
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The archive is accessible from the homepage. Add the following snippet below <code>menu:main:</code> in the <code>config.yml</code> file to make the archive available from the menu:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-yml" data-lang="yml"><span style="display:flex;"><span>- <span style="color:#000">name</span>: <span style="color:#1c01ce">Archive  </span>

<hr>
<h2 id="social-icons">Social icons<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#social-icons">#</a></h2>
<p>The template includes various social icons that are commonly used in academia. All the icons are defined in the file <code>layouts/partials/svg.html</code>; additional icons can be added there. To place any icon on the homepage, the icon type and icon url should be specified below <code>params:socialIcons:</code> in <code>config.yml</code>.</p>
<p>For instance, if your CV is called <code>cv.pdf</code> and placed in the <code>static</code> folder, an icon linking to your CV can be added as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-yml" data-lang="yml"><span style="display:flex;"><span>- <span style="color:#000">name</span>: <span style="color:#1c01ce">CV</span>

<h2 id="typesetting-math">Typesetting math<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#typesetting-math">#</a></h2>
<p>It is easy to typeset math on any website page. Simply enter LaTeX commands into the Markdown file, and the commands will be rendered synchronously with <a href="https://katex.org" target="_blank">KaTeX</a>
.</p>
<p>For instance <code>$x\in \mathbb{N}$</code> is rendered as $x\in \mathbb{N}$. <code>$\xi^\ast = \max f(x)$</code> is rendered as $\xi^\ast = \max f(x)$. And <code>$4 \ln(\theta+\mathcal{Y}) =4 \int \ln(x^2)dx$</code> is rendered as $4 \ln(\theta+\mathcal{Y}) =4 \int \ln(x^2)dx$.</p>
<p>It is also possible to display equations on any webpage. For example, <code>$$1+\lambda\exp{\frac{\beta}{\alpha^2}} = \max_{t\in\mathbb{R}}(x(t)-y(t)+z(t)^2)$$</code> is rendered as:</p>

<h2 id="color-scheme">Color scheme<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#color-scheme">#</a></h2>
<p>Most of the website produced by the template is in grayscale. For ease of navigation, however, links underlined in orange. The same orange color is used for the website&rsquo;s favicon, and a lighter shade of orange is used for hovered buttons.</p>
<p>It is easy to personalize the color used for links and buttons. The orange color is specified in the file <code>assets/css/core/theme-vars.css</code>. The code snippet specifying the color is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#000">--darkcolor</span><span style="color:#000">:</span> #<span style="color:#000">d95f0e</span><span style="color:#000">;</span>

<h2 id="footer">Footer<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#footer">#</a></h2>
<p>The website has a footer. The footer contains a copyright notice and a &ldquo;Powered by&rdquo; notice. The footer can be customized by modifying the file <code>layouts/partials/footer.html</code>. It is possible to hide the footer by setting the parameter <code>hideFooter</code> to <code>true</code> in the <code>config.yml</code> file.</p>

<h2 id="cover-images">Cover images<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#cover-images">#</a></h2>
<p>Cover images can be specified for all pages. The cover image will appear in lists on the website. It will also appear if a link to the page is used on social media.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the page for the first paper on the website, &ldquo;Unusual Uses For Olive Oil&rdquo;.
A cover image for the page is specified at the top of the <code>index.md</code> file in the <code>content/papers/paper1/</code> folder:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-yml" data-lang="yml"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#000">cover</span>:

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#000">relative</span>: <span style="color:#a90d91">false</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The cover image is <code>paper1.png</code>, found in the same folder as the <code>index.md</code> file. The image is in PNG format, which is the recommended format for cover images.</p>
<p>Cover images should be 1280x720 pixels. This size ensures that the cover image has a 16:9 aspect ratio (recommended for most social media), have a good resolution, while not being too large (100–300 KB is recommended). The image should also have some white padding around, to prevent important material from being cropped out.</p>
<p>To produce good cover images, <a href="https://imagemagick.org" target="_blank">Image Magick</a>
 is a great software. It is free and open source and can be obtained on a Mac with Homebrew: <code>brew install imagemagick</code>. Once you have installed Image Magick, you can transform any image in PNG format to a cover image of the appropriate size with some padding:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span style="display:flex;"><span>magick image.png -resize 1200x675 -gravity center -background white -extent 1280x720 image.png

<h2 id="rss-feeds">RSS feeds<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#rss-feeds">#</a></h2>
<p>In the background, Hugo automatically generates RSS feeds in XML format for your site. These feeds enable interested readers to subscribe to your content and be updated whenever you publish new content. The RSS feeds can be found in the <code>public</code> folder, and are typically available at <code>/index.xml</code> under the appropriate section.</p>
<p>For instance, on this website, the RSS feed for my research papers can be found at <code>https://pascalmichaillat.org/papers/index.xml</code>. The RSS feed for my design projects can be found at <code>https://pascalmichaillat.org/design/index.xml</code>. Hugo also produces RSS feeds for all keywords. On this website, the RSS feed for the keyword <code>business cycles</code> can be found at <code>https://pascalmichaillat.org/tags/business-cycles/index.xml</code> and the RSS feed for the keyword <code>recessions</code> can be found at <code>https://pascalmichaillat.org/tags/recessions/index.xml</code>.</p>
<p>The XML files can then be submitted to RSS readers, such as the <a href="https://rss.app" target="_blank">RSS app</a>
, to <a href="https://rss.app/overview-feed-xml?feedId=44ZDQRZnqIktQJrt&amp;feedXmlId=UaViYplhbFwE97Bd" target="_blank">produce RSS feeds</a>

<h2 id="search">Search<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#search">#</a></h2>
<p>A search page can also be added to the website. To add a search  page, move the <code>search.md</code> file from the <code>archetypes</code> folder into the <code>content</code> folder. Then, add the following snippet at the end of the <code>config.yml</code> file so that search works properly:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-yml" data-lang="yml"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#000">outputs</span>:

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>         - <span style="color:#1c01ce">JSON</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Finally, add the following snippet below <code>menu:main:</code> in the <code>config.yml</code> file to make the search page available from the menu:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-yml" data-lang="yml"><span style="display:flex;"><span>- <span style="color:#000">name</span>: <span style="color:#1c01ce">Search  </span>

<h2 id="archetypes">Archetypes<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#archetypes">#</a></h2>
<p>The template comes with archetypes, stored in the <code>archetypes</code> folder. In Hugo, an archetype is a predefined content template that serves as a blueprint for creating new pages. Archetypes help streamline content creation by providing a consistent starting point with predefined metadata and content structure. There is an archetype for paper pages (<code>paper.md</code>) and an archetype for course pages (<code>course.md</code>).</p>
<p>To create a new webpage from an archetype, simply use the <code>hugo new</code> command in the terminal from the website directory. For example, to create a page for a new course, you can run:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span style="display:flex;"><span>hugo new content/courses/my-new-teaching-material.md --kind course
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Hugo will generate a new content file called <code>my-new-teaching-material.md</code> and place it the directory <code>content/courses/</code>, where all the courses are stored. Furthermore, Hugo will use the archetype <code>course.md</code>. Then, you can edit the content of the page by modifying the newly created file <code>my-new-teaching-material.md</code>.</p>
<p>Similarly, to create a page for a new paper, you can run:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span style="display:flex;"><span>hugo new content/papers/my-new-research-material.md --kind paper
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Hugo will generate a new content file called <code>my-new-research-material.md</code> and place it the directory <code>content/papers/</code>, where all the papers are stored. Furthermore, Hugo will use the archetype <code>paper.md</code>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="redirects">Redirects<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#redirects">#</a></h2>
<p>It is easy to handle redirects on a Hugo website by using the <code>aliases</code> parameter within the page front matter. This feature allows you to define old URLs that should redirect to a new page. This is particularly useful when you change the URL structure or move content around in your website, and you want to ensure that visitors are redirected from the old URLs to the new one. This ensures that visitors using the old URLs still find the right content.</p>
<p>The template includes an example showing how to set up redirects using the <code>aliases</code> parameter. The redirects are set up in the <code>/courses/course1/index.md</code> file. In the preamble, the following snippet of code sets up redirects from old PDF files to the current course page:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-yml" data-lang="yml"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#000">aliases</span>: 
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    - <span style="color:#1c01ce">/courses/course2/slides4.pdf</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    - <span style="color:#1c01ce">/courses/course2/slides1.pdf</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    - <span style="color:#1c01ce">/courses/course2/slides3.pdf</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    - <span style="color:#1c01ce">/courses/course2/slides2.pdf</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    - <span style="color:#1c01ce">/courses/course2/notes3.pdf</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    - <span style="color:#1c01ce">/courses/course2/notes4.pdf</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    - <span style="color:#1c01ce">/courses/course2/ps3.pdf</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    - <span style="color:#1c01ce">/courses/course2/ps4.pdf</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    - <span style="color:#1c01ce">/courses/course1/quiz1.pdf</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    - <span style="color:#1c01ce">/courses/course1/quiz2.pdf</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    - <span style="color:#1c01ce">/courses/course2/quiz3.pdf</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    - <span style="color:#1c01ce">/courses/course2/quiz4.pdf</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    - <span style="color:#1c01ce">/courses/course1/ps1.pdf</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Hugo will then automatically generate the necessary redirect HTML pages during the build process. These HTML pages will be stored in the <code>public</code> folder. When a visitor navigates to any of the URLs listed in the aliases (such as <code>baseURL/courses/course2/slides4.pdf</code>), they will be redirected to the page where the alias is defined (<code>baseURL/courses/course1/</code>).</p>
<p>This method is useful to manage redirects and ensure a seamless user experience when restructuring any part of your website. It is also useful to handle 404 issues since outdated links will automatically point to the correct content, preventing users from landing on the <a href="https://pascalmichaillat.org/hugo-website/404/" target="_blank">404 error page</a>
.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="public-folder">Public folder<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#public-folder">#</a></h2>
<p>The <code>public</code> folder contains the fully generated static website files that are ready to be deployed to GitHub Pages. When you run the <code>hugo</code> command, Hugo processes your content, templates, and other project files and generates a static website. The resulting output is placed in the <code>public</code> folder by default.</p>
<p>The <code>public</code> folder can always be safely deleted. A new version of the <code>public</code> folder will be created when you run the <code>hugo</code> command in the terminal.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="domain-name">Domain name<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#domain-name">#</a></h2>
<p>It is easy to use a custom domain name for the website. For instance, the domain name <code>https://pascalmichaillat.org/</code> is registered with <a href="https://domains.squarespace.com" target="_blank">Squarespace</a>
. Once you have registered a domain, you need to <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages" target="_blank">link it</a>
 to your website. Make sure that the <code>baseURL</code> parameter in <code>config.yml</code> reflects the custom domain name. Make sure that the <a href="https://github.com/pmichaillat/hugo-website/settings/pages" target="_blank">page setting</a>
 on GitHub also includes the domain name.</p>

<h2 id="tips-for-job-market-candidates">Tips for job-market candidates<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#tips-for-job-market-candidates">#</a></h2>
<p>This template is designed for researchers at all levels, including students, postdocs, faculty members, and professional scientists. When preparing your website for the job market, it might make sense to adapt the website slightly.</p>
<h3 id="job-market-status">Job-market status<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#job-market-status">#</a></h3>
<p>To announce your job-market status, you can modify the subtitle on the landing page. You could for instance add</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-markdown" data-lang="markdown"><span style="display:flex;"><span>**In 2024/2025, I will be on the academic job market.**
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>to the text under <code>params:profileMode:subtitle</code> in the <code>config.yml</code> file.</p>
<p>You could also add more information, such as who your references are, how to contact them, which job-market meetings you will attend, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="buttons-for-job-market-paper-and-cv">Buttons for job-market paper and CV<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#buttons-for-job-market-paper-and-cv">#</a></h3>
<p>I would also advise to place prominent links to your CV and job-market paper on the landing page. This can be easily achieved by adding the following code snippet below <code>profileMode:buttons:</code> in the <code>config.yml</code> file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-yml" data-lang="yml"><span style="display:flex;"><span>- <span style="color:#000">name</span>: <span style="color:#1c01ce">Job-market paper</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#000">url</span>: <span style="color:#1c01ce">jmp.pdf</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>- <span style="color:#000">name</span>: <span style="color:#1c01ce">Curriculum vitae</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#000">url</span>: <span style="color:#1c01ce">cv.pdf</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This code snippet will add buttons for your job-market paper (<code>jmp.pdf</code>) and CV (<code>cv.pdf</code>) below the social icons on the homepage. The files <code>cv.pdf</code> and <code>jmp.pdf</code> must be placed in the <code>static</code> folder.</p>
