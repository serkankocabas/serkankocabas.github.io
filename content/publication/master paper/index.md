abstract: This paper studies how carbon policy shocks affect firms’ investment decisions differently, using 3 million firm-level observations on investment from the ORBIS database. The carbon policy shocks are constructed by employing high-frequency data and the structural environment of the European carbon market after replicating Kanzig (2021)’s methodology. The impact of the carbon policy shocks on firms’ investment is estimated using a local projection approach, specifically, panel OLS local projection, presented by Jordá (2005) and following Cloyne et al. (2018). Firms’ investment reactions to carbon policy shocks are heterogeneous. Foremost, firms react to carbon policy shocks contemporaneously. The second finding is that, when considering the firms’ age, younger firms have the highest investment reaction to carbon policy shocks. If we consider the firms’ size, our third finding shows that small-sized firms are taking the lead in investment response after the carbon policy shocks hit. Further findings show that the high-leveraged firms have a stronger reaction compared to others. However, firms respond similarly at the sectoral level, meaning there is a presence of inter-sectoral input-output linkages after the carbon policy shocks. Finally, industries that produce non-durable goods within the manufacturing sector have much stronger investment reactions than others.
