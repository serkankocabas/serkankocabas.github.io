      This study examines the heterogeneous effects of carbon policy shocks on firm investment using approximately 2.7 million firm-year observations for non-financial corporations in Germany, France, Italy, and Spain from 2000 to 2018, sourced from the ORBIS database. To identify exogenous policy changes, we used the high-frequency carbon policy shocks developed by KÃ¤nzig (2021). We then estimate the dynamic effects of these shocks using panel local projections (JordÃ¡ (2005); Cloyne et al. (2018)). Our findings reveal that investments adjust both contemporaneously and heterogeneously. Notably, younger, smaller, and more highly leveraged firms show the most significant reduction in investment, both in terms of impact and over the following two years. In contrast, the average responses are similar across broad sectors, a finding consistent with inter-sectoral input-output linkages that diffuse carbon-induced cost changes throughout the production network. However, within the manufacturing sector, non-durable goods industries respond more strongly than durable goods industries. These results map the short-run distribution of adjustment costs from carbon pricing, and can guide the design of complementary policies for vulnerable firms.
