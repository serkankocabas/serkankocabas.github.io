+ If we are meeting to discuss research, please send me a written description of the work that you would like to discus. Presentation slides or paper draft are perfectly fine. If you do not have those, please send a one-page description of the research. 
+ If we have already met in the past to discuss research, please send me an update on your work since our previous meeting. Include responses to each point on your to-do list from the previous meeting. 
+ Please send me the material by 8pm on the evening before our meeting.
