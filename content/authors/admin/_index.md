I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at [Universidad Carlos III de Madrid](https://economics.uc3m.es/jobmarket/). During my Ph.D., I completed a Ph.D. traineeship at the [European Central Bank](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html) and previously worked as an Economist at [BBVA-Research](https://www.bbvaresearch.com/en/search/?searchbbvaresearch=serkan%20kocabas).

My research focuses on quantitative macroeconomics, with particular interests in monetary policy transmission, financial frictions, and climate economics (carbon policy). My methodology combines empirical analysis with quantitative theory, including New Keynesian DSGE models.

**My Job Market Paper:** <br>[Bridging the Gap: How Banks’ Maturity Mismatch Shapes Monetary Policy Transmission](uploads/Kocabas_JMP.pdf)

I will be on the 2025 / 2026 academic job market.
