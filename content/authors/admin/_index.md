## About Me

I am an economist currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Economics at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid while working as a Ph.D. trainee at the European Central Bank. Prior to my doctoral studies, I gained valuable experience as an Economist at BBVA-Research. I completed my Master of Research in Economic Analysis at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. Additionally, I hold a Master of Science in Macroeconomic Policy and Financial Markets from the Barcelona School of Economics, and I obtained my bachelor's degree in Economics from Middle East Technical University.

My research focuses on Fiscal and Monetary policies, International Macro, and Quantitative Macro, with a current emphasis on climate change and firm heterogeneity.
