I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at [Universidad Carlos III de Madrid](https://economics.uc3m.es/jobmarket/). During my Ph.D., I completed a Ph.D. traineeship at the [European Central Bank](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html) and previously worked as an Economist at [BBVA-Research](https://www.bbvaresearch.com/en/search/?searchbbvaresearch=serkan%20kocabas).

My research focuses on monetary policy, international macroeconomics, and quantitative macroeconomics, with particular attention to climate change and bank and firm heterogeneity. I use quantitative models and micro data to study how policy shocks transmit to the real economy.

I will be on the 2025 / 2026 academic job market.
