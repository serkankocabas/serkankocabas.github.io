              Responsibilities include:

              * Working on a research project exploring the impact of bank supply shocks on firm-level investment in France, Spain, Italy, and Germany using the AnaCredit credit-registry and Orbis firm-level database. By decomposing loan growth into bank supply, firm demand, industry, and common shocks following Amiti and Weinstein (2018), we find that idiosyncratic bank supply shocks play a significant role in shaping investment dynamics from 2019 to 2023. We also find that the effects of bank supply shocks vary depending on firm characteristics such as size, age, sector, and reliance on bank loans.
